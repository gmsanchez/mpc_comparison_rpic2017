Support material for "MPC for nonlinear systems: a comparative review of discretization methods".

In order to run these examples you will need [CasADi](http://www.casadi.org) version >= 3.1.0 to be installed on your system and (optionally) the [HSL MA27](http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/ipopt/) linear solver. You can find CasADi installation instructions [here](https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/InstallationInstructions). Once you have CasADi working, you can follow HSL installation instructions [here](https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/Obtaining-HSL).
